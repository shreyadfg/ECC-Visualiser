# ECC-Visualiser
This project is an educational Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) playground built to make ECC understandable, visual, and hands-on. Instead of hiding everything behind cryptography libraries, the entire ECC stack is implemented from scratch, with clear logging, plots, and an interactive GUI.
